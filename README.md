# Computer Science Coursework

This is my A-Level coursework for my Computer Science course which contains the prototype for the Lisburn LeisurePlex Lesson Manager System. This is used to manage swimmers by **marking attendance**, **writing notes**, **assessing swimmers** etc.

# The Frontend (Tkinter)
My UI for the system will be made using Python's wonderful and hassle-free Tkinter framework.

Whilst overall design and flair is lacking it does the job :)
# The Backend (SQLite 3)
I will also be using SQLite 3 as my database of choice to store/update various details for the system when needed.

## **RUN THE APP IN 'main_app.py"**
