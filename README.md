# Computer Science Coursework

This is my project for the Lisburn LeisurePlex Lesson Manager System.

# The Frontend (Tkinter)
My UI for the system will be made using Python's wonderful and hassle-free Tkinter framework.

Whilst overall design and flair is lacking it does the job :)
# The Backend (SQLite 3)
I will also be using SQLite 3 as my database of choice to store various details for the system.
